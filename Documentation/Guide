Based on your code, I'll create a user-friendly, non-technical documentation for your Discord bot's guide system. Here's how I would explain it to your server users:

## 🏛️ Imperial Codex - Your Server Guide System

### What is the Imperial Codex?

The Imperial Codex is your personal assistant for navigating our Discord server! Think of it as a smart help system that learns what you need and makes it easy to find information about our community, games, bots, and features.

### How to Access the Guide

**There are several ways to get help:**

1. **Mention the bot** - Simply tag our bot in any message and ask for help
   - `@ImperialCodex help` - Opens the main menu
   - `@ImperialCodex commands` - Shows bot commands
   - `@ImperialCodex music` - Get music bot information
   - `@ImperialCodex rules` - View server guidelines

2. **Ask natural questions** - The bot understands normal conversation!
   - "How do I play music?"
   - "What are the server rules?"
   - "Where can I find free games?"
   - "How do I get roles?"

### 🔄 Updated When I Can
This guide is maintained by a single person (me!), so updates aren’t instant. Whenever new features, bots, or information are added to the server, I’ll update the guide as soon as I have the time. I do my best to keep it current so you can always find the latest server info in one place.

### ❓ Still Need Help?

If the guide system doesn't answer your question:
- Try different search terms
- Ask in our community forum channels
- The bot learns from usage, so popular questions get easier to find over time

**Remember**: The Imperial Codex is designed to be conversational and intuitive. Don't overthink it - just ask what you want to know, and it will guide you to the right information! 🎯

The system gets smarter the more people use it, creating a better experience for everyone in the community.

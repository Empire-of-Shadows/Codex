## Important Notes
### Permissions
- You need at least the Silver Fang role to use any embed commands
- Higher roles unlock more features and color options
- Administrators can edit any bot embed, regardless of who created it

### Time Limits
- You have 1 hour after creating an embed to edit it
- After 1 hour, only administrators can edit your embeds
- The system automatically cleans up expired edit permissions

### Cooldowns
- Commands have cooldowns to prevent spam
- Cooldowns may vary based on the specific command used
- Wait for the cooldown to expire before using the command again

### Error Messages
- "‚ùå You don't have permission" - You need a higher role
- "‚ùå Session has expired" - The 1-hour edit window has passed
- "‚ùå Invalid message link" - Check your message link format
- "‚ùå Not a valid bot embed" - You can only edit bot-created embeds

## Tips for Users
1. **Planning Your Embed:** Think about what you want to include before opening the create modal
2. **Color Selection:** Use `/embed colors` first to see your options
3. **Feature Check:** Use `/embed features` to see what's available to you
4. **Quick Edits:** Make edits within the first hour to avoid needing admin help
5. **Message Links:** Right-click and "Copy Message Link" is the easiest way to get the link for editing

This system is designed to provide a smooth embed creation experience while maintaining organized access based on your server role. The higher your role, the more creative control you have over your embeds!
